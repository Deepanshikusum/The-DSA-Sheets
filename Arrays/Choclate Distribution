Given an array of N integers where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that: 

Each student gets one packet.
The difference between the number of chocolates in the packet with maximum chocolates and the packet with minimum chocolates given to the students is minimum.

Solution:-

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// arr[0..n-1] represents sizes of packets
// m is number of students.
// Returns minimum difference between maximum
// and minimum values of distribution.
int findMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int m)
{
	// if there are no chocolates or number
	// of students is 0
	if (m == 0 || n == 0)
		return 0;

	// Sort the given packets
	sort(arr, arr + n);

	// Number of students cannot be more than
	// number of packets
	if (n < m)
		return -1;

	// Largest number of chocolates
	int min_diff = INT_MAX;

	

	for (int i = 0; i + m - 1 < n; i++) {
		int diff = arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i];
		if (diff < min_diff)
			min_diff = diff;
	}
	return min_diff;
}
