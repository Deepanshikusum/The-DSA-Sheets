You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Solution:-
    class Solution {
    public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& h) {
        int l=0;
        int r=h.size()-1;
        int maxw=0;
        while(l<=r){
            int a=min(h[l],h[r])*(r-l);
            if(a>maxw){
                maxw=a;
            }
            if(h[l]<h[r]){
                l++;
            }
            else{
                r--;
            }
        }
        return maxw;
    }
};
